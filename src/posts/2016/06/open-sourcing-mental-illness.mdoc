title: Open Sourcing Mental Illness
---

Watching [YAPCNA][] videos, and the most important to me today is
[Ed Finkler][]'s talk about
mental health among developers. His [OSMI][] project - Open Sourcing Mental
Illness - aims to improve workplace and community awareness and resources for
mental health. Good stuff. Many domains and communities need this effort,
and his chosen community is tech. Worth checking out.
