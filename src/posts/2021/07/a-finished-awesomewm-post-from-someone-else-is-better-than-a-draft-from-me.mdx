title: A finished Awesomewm post from someone else is better than a draft from me
---

[awesome]: https://awesomewm.org

I've been revisiting my [awesome][] config, starting by refactoring the default `rc.lua`.  Was even
thinking about making a post.

[Modularized Awesome WM Configuration Structure]: https://epsi-rns.github.io/desktop/2016/07/06/modularized-awesome-structure.html

[Epsi]: https://epsi-rns.github.io

Then I remembered to look at [Epsi][]'s blog, which I already knew to be a great resource for
Awesome.  And hey [Modularized Awesome WM Configuration Structure][] is the post I want to write,
except better. Plenty of other great posts there too.
