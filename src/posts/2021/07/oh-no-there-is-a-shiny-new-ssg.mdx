title: oh no there is a shiny new SSG
---

[Astro]: https://astro.build

Saw [Astro][] mentioned in my Twitter feed today.
Tempting.

[Eleventy]: https://11ty.dev
[Gatsby]: https://gatsbyjs.com

Been looking for a gateway SSG into JavaScript. Something with a little more
built-in than [Eleventy][], but maybe a bit less than [Gatsby][]. I think I'll
play with Astro â€” see if it keeps my attention.

Will it keep my attention long enough to replace the Hugo version? Precedent
says "no." But it should be fun just the same.
