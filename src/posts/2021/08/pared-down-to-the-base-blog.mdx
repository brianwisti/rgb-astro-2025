title: pared down to the base blog
---

No more content shortcodes. No more — or at least not many — exotic content
formats. Embedded video or tweet? Copy and paste the embed code from the host
site. Need some fancy HTML for notes? Use raw HTML.

I need a base blog, with minimal dependencies on [Hugo][hugo] or any other
[SSG][ssg], so I can get serious with some of those others. "I'd need to port
all my shortcodes" has blocked me from switching for the last year and a half
(you accumulate a lot of cruft using the same site builder for six years). Now
it won't be such a blocker.

Plus, I can try the fancy stuff in [Astro][astro] or [Lektor][lektor] or
whatever and still have the base blog to fall back on. Heck, I could port the
base blog to [Eleventy][eleventy] or [Zola][zola] or …
