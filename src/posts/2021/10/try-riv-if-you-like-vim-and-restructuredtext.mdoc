title: Try Riv if you like Vim and reStructuredText
---

[Riv][riv] is a wiki, but feels like more of a notebook. Think [Deft for
Emacs][deft] with journaling and HTML publishing. What makes Riv interesting —
aside from the [Vim][vim] thing — is that it uses [reStructuredText][rst] for
its native format.

It works well enough, especially once you build up muscle memory for Riv's
leader sequence <kbd>C-e</kbd>. Don't overload it right away though! It
includes some insert mode mappings, which can get real confusing if your
preferred leader is a space.

Meanwhile I got a lot of {{< tag "neovim" >}} ideas. Course, I need to get some
more practice in with [pynvim][pynvim] first. And I suppose some more practice
with Riv.
