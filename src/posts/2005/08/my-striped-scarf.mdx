title: My Striped Scarf
---

This started out as the "maximum scarf" from the Knit Stitch book, but I got
bored and went for a modified version of "Joelâ€™s Scarf" instead. This is sport
weight yarn, 60 stitch cast on, and and only 3 colors instead of 7. It has
turned out to be my most popular scarf.
