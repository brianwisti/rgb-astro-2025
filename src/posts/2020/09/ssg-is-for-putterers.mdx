[WordPress Creator Vs The Jamstack]: 

Kev Quirk on static site generators:

SSGs are really cool and super fun to play with – I’m really enjoying it on
my side project; but I wish a lot of devs would stop touting about how
amazingly simple they are, as it’s just not the case.

I often see "such and such static site generator is simple!" tweets, and wonder what exactly they're
comparing it to. DIY dentistry perhaps?

[some SSGs]: https://www.11ty.dev/

As much as I love puttering with static site generators, "puttering" is the main charm of an SSG.
The hooks to customize are right there on the surface. Heck [some SSGs][] are nothing *but* hooks. And
having everything in a git repository is just a developer-focused version of a smart backup plan.

For the [Jamstack][] side of things, I'm not sure I see the advantage of relying on a load of external
services over oh say for example having a database and an internal comment system. You know, like
Wordpress. Something I've been thinking about a lot in relation to my own site leaning so much on
[webmention.io][].
