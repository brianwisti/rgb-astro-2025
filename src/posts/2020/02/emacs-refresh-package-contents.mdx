Tried adding [Evil](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) with
[use-package](/post/2019/11/emacs-use-package). Didn’t work.

Didn’t write the error message down, of course. Something about MELPA
looking for a package version from two months ago and deciding the
package was "Not Found".

Eventually figured out I need to run `package-refresh-contents`, which
grabs the latest package listings. Might be overkill to run that
automatically in every Emacs session, so I won’t add it to my `.emacs`.

I will add a comment though.

``` elisp
;; Package not installing?
;;  Try 'M-x package-refresh-contents'

(require 'package)
```

Hopefully I remember to read my own comments.

Or the
[documentation](https://evil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation-via-package-el).
