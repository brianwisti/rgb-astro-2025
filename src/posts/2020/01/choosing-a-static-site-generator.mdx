title: Choosing a static site generator
---

I enjoyed a recent post on [picking a static site generator in
2020](https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator).
Along with explaining the *what* and *why* of SSGs, the post lists a few
favorites. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io),
[Eleventy](https://1ty.dev), and even the now-venerable
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) get highlighted. So do a few that are still new
to me, like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and
[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/). I’ll probably try those too at some
point.

Nothing about [Nikola](https://getnikola.com). Too bad\! It’s a blast to tinker
with.

My suggestion? If you have a business need, follow *that*. But if you
want to have fun? Try them all! Write code to carry posts forward from
one generator to the next!

And try making your own sometime. That’s fun too!

Okay, I admit it. I have weird ideas of fun.
