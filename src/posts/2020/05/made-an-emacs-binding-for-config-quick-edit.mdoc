title: Made an Emacs Binding for Config Quick Edit
---

I hit `F5`, Emacs opens my
[`config.org`](/post/2020/04/from-dotfiles-to-org-file) for editing. It
might not be much but it feels good to scratch such a specific itch.
Feeling pretty good about myself.

``` elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<f5>")
                (lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (find-file "~/.dotfiles/config.org")))
```
