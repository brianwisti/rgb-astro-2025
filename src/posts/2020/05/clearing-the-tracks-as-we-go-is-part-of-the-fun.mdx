    If I waited until I had the perfect toolchain for it, then I’d never start.

I agree. Sorry for the delay in replying. I needed to create and/or fake
the missing pieces of my workflow so I *could* reply.

And your reply came through just fine! Course, now I need to go fix the
bit where it’s not showing up on the note you’re replying to.

I'm not sure why.
Maybe the communal storytelling.
The "losing is fun" core ethic of Dwarf Fortress seems relevant, too.
