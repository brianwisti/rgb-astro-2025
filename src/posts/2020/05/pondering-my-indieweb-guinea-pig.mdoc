title: Pondering My Indieweb Guinea Pig

[IndieWeb]: https://indieweb.org
[Web::Mention]: https://metacpan.org/pod/Web::Mention
[webmention-tools]: https://github.com/Ryuno-Ki/webmention-tools

<a class="u-category h-card" href="https://jmac.org">Jason McIntosh</a> seems
like a reasonable choice to test Webmentions on. I wouldn’t know about the
[IndieWeb][] if not for him. I know I’ll try his [Web::Mention][] library
eventually. But first, [webmention-tools][].

The other stuff didn’t work and didn’t give useful errors. I ended up
using Web::Mention. It’s fine. Just half to rewrite half the post.
That’s fine.
