[MojoX::Date::Local]: https://metacpan.org/pod/MojoX::Date::Local
[Mojo::Date]: https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojo/Date

If anything about [MojoX::Date::Local][] seems a bit off, that's because it's my first CPAN package.
It's just [Mojo::Date][] with a tiny bit of date formatting and time zone stuff I needed in a couple projects.
Not time zone *math*.

No.

God no.

Just showing local time.
