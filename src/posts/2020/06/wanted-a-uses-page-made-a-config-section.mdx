title: Wanted a uses page, made a config section
---

[uses]: https://genehack.org/uses/
[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io
[go-org]: https://github.com/niklasfasching/go-org
[john sj anderson]: https://genehack.org

All jealous of [john sj anderson][]'s [uses][] page.
Started making my own.
Decided it would be easier just to share my config.
Might as well, since [Hugo][] directly supports org content via [go-org][].

I'll add `/uses` later.

In the middle of a big Astro revamp for the site.
Haven't figured out what to do with the config section from the old site --
especially considering how out of date it was!
