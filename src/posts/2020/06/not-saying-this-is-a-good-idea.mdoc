title: Not saying this is a good idea

[VcXsrv]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
[awesomewm]: https://awesomewm.org/
[Emacs]: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
[WSL]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/

One big window for [VcXsrv][].
[awesomewm][] for a window manager.
Mainly to manage maximized [Emacs][].
There are easier ways to edit files in Windows and [WSL][].
But it renders prettier fonts than VcXsrv with floating windows, so I think I'll keep it.
After I fix all the hotkeys, of course.

I used [this post][] from [Paul Silisteanu][] as a general guide, except `apt install awesome awesome-extra` for the
awesomewm  stuff.
