title: Patronize Me on Liberapay
---

Been skimming through [ethical.net](https://ethical.net) resources
recently. [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/) looks interesting: a
patronage system like Patreon, but without reward tiers. More of a "keep
doing — whatever the hell it is that you’re doing — it’s great"
approach. So I [joined](https://en.liberapay.com/randomgeek/) of course.
Give me money and I’ll keep doing exactly what I’ve been doing. Such a
deal!

Added a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account, which should simplify Liberapay and life in general.
