title: A Couple Crochet Hats
---

I crocheted two hats from [Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet][] over the last week or so.

[Stitch 'N Bitch Crochet]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57512.Stitch_n_Bitch_Crochet

The "Anarchy Irony Hat" would have turned out better if I understood satin stitch. I think I got it now. But
this has a certain goofy charm.

The gray and black "Boy Beanie" came out much nicer, even with my intentional
variations from the book. I doubt I could follow a pattern to the letter even if I wrote the pattern myself.

I think that's it! I'm all caught up on finished yarn projects. Time to write about other stuff. And knit, of
course.
