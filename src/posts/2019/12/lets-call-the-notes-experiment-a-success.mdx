title: Let's call the notes experiment a success
---

Yep. I love the [Notes][note] experiment. It encourages me to post quick
thoughts frequently.

[note]: /categories/note
[tags]: /tags
[blog]: /categories/post

Iâ€™m officially assimilating [Notes][note] into the main flow of the site. That
means [tags][tags] instead of their own taxonomy. It also means they get listed
with posts in the [blog][blog].

Got a few ideas for a tidy separation of the two, but for taxonomy and
history we are back to one main flow.
