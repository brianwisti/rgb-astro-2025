title: Some manual symmetry with Linea Sketch

[WelshPixie][] draws amazing mandala images. Inspired me to do something in [Linea Sketch][], a drawing app defined
by its constraints. No symmetry tools. A focused approach to color palettes. Brushes limited to a couple
pencils, a couple pens. Five layers, no more and no less. Stuff like that.

It does have circle and straight edge drawing tools, which I clearly took full advantage of.

The only feature I miss in Linea is custom canvas sizes. All drawings are exactly however many pixels your
iPad has.
