title: I FIXED MY .Pages
---

Too tired to make it make sense. My site broke under Hugo .58. No front page listing. I fixed it. Yay!

Instead of (for notes):

```
{{- range first 1 (where .Pages "Section" "note") -}}
```

I used

```
{{- range first 1 (where .Site.RegularPages "Section" "note") -}}
```

I also fixed the RSS feed, and updated the [feeds post][] with those (very similar) details.
