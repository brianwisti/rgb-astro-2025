[Ello][]? I only remember you exist because of your emails. Delete account.

[MeWe][]? No API. Delete account.

[Instagram][]? No API. Awful link handling. Delete account. Delete ---del--- I said "delete" dammit.

Maybe later. Uninstalled from my phone at least.

Oh right, speaking of emails. [Classmates][]. What a terrible idea that was. Nostalgia is not my strong suit.
Delete account.

That one took a minute.

[Facebook][]? Well, that's my main contact for too many folks. I can uninstall it though.

Oh, I can only disable it. Yeah you're on the list now too, [Samsung][].

Leaving the rest because I have other stuff to do.

This note reflects entirely too foul of a mood. Throwing in a drawing from the other day. There. Now smile.
