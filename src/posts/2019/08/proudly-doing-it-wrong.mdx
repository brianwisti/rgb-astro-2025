Write a [site weight][] script that prints a report to the console.
Make the script write the report to a file, and include the file in [/now][].
Now site building looks like:

1. build the site
2. weigh the site
3. build the site and include the new report
4. upload!

Today - make the script write the info as JSON instead.
Throw in some [vue.js][] to fetch the JSON and reproduce the original report format almost exactly.
Profit?

But hey at least I don't need to rebuild the site after weighing it. And when free time next allows I'll learn a little more Vue.js and make the report prettier.
