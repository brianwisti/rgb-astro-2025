title: Saving some links from Perl 6 Weekly
---

Haven't done anything interesting related to [Perl 6][] for _years_, but I still
subscribe to the [Perl 6 Weekly][] blog. Several links caught my eye this week.

[Perl 6]: https://raku.org/
[Perl 6 Weekly]: https://p6weekly.wordpress.com/

* [Jeff Goff][] started a fresh series on implementing Template Toolkit in Perl 6.
* Madeleine Goebel is making great progress on a GSOC project [making `perl6` produce executable binaries][]
* Andrew Shitov wrote a pleasant baby steps sort of intro on [using NativeCall][] for accessing C
  libraries from Perl 6.
* Some sort of Chef/Ansible style task runner, called [Sparrow6][]

Anyways, back to work and Python, which is also fun!
