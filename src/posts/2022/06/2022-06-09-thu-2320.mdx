Meanwhile, in [Obsidian][obsidian]:

![Obsidian page with a Dataview table](/img/2022/2022-06-09-obsidian-types.png "Using an Obsidian plugin to organize the mess I made in Obsidian.")

[Logseq][logseq] is great. Native outlining, org-like tasks, the power of
[Datalog][datalog]. But Obsidian has the [Dataview][dataview] plugin. What you
feed it looks a lot like SQL.

[datalog]: https://www.learndatalogtoday.org
[dataview]: https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/

```
TABLE
  length(rows) as "Notes"
from ""
where isa != null
GROUP BY isa
SORT isa ASC
```

I kinda know SQL already. Enough to know what to look up to make a table of
note types.

| Group       | Notes
| ----------- | -------
| Book        | 3
| Game        | 5
| Meeting     | 1
| Movie       | 1
| Package     | 1
| Person      | 41
| Pet         | 4
| Project     | 1
| Source Note | 16

Nope. Haven't settled on One True Note System and I likely never will. But at
least I'm enjoying myself.
