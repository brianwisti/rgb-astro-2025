I'm not dead yet! Site wasn't updating because Netlify failed with an `exit
code 2`. Bit vague. Finally had a few minutes to look closer.

Turns out it's because I've been keeping up locally with Hugo releases and
syntax changes, but not telling Netlify. They need the same version of Hugo
that I use.

So now I've got a basic `netlify.toml` based on [Netlify Hugo
docs][netlify-hugo].

[netlify-hugo]: https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/hugo/

```toml
[build]
  command = "hugo"
  publish = "public"

[build.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.101.0"
```

Looks like everything is good again.
