I'm gonna fill this space with the contents of a tweet thread describing my
adventures importing Taskwarrior tasks into Logseq.

Course, it started as a toot thread. But I don't have a shortcode handy for
embedding those. You get a link:

Right, I started with Obsidian. Then I thought about how Logseq has task
management features built-in. Decided to shift focus there. Took me a bit to
figure out how I wanted to link everything up. Ended up with a more cohesive
graph --- to my eyes, at least.

The secondary purpose was to get more comfortable using [TypeScript][ts] and
[Node.js][node]. I didn't revert to Python, Perl, or Ruby for *any* of this.
Mission accomplished!

[ts]: https://www.typescriptlang.org
[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/

You want to *see* the code? Ah. Well. Maybe later. This was flailing and
puttering code, not showing off code.

```bash
task add project:Site +blog \
  write better on taskwarrior logseq import
```

There. Now it can haunt me for the next couple years.
