Started playing with local `custom.css` to tweak the [Panic][panic-theme] theme
for [Logseq][logseq].

[panic-theme]: https://github.com/sokirill/logseq-panic-theme
[logseq]: https://logseq.com

![Logseq page in Logseq with custom style](/img/2022/logseq-custom-panic-2022-06-08.png "Some of those jots go back to Logseq 0.1.x, so don't trust them.")

I changed the default text font to [OpenDyslexic][open-dyslexic] and code to
the [Nerd Fonts][nerd-fonts] version of [Fantasque Sans Mono][fantasque-sans].
No I'm not dyslexic --- at least I'm pretty sure I'm not --- but I find these
friendlier and easier to read than the more severe fonts in common use. I
usually install them locally on whatever device I use for ready access.

[open-dyslexic]: https://opendyslexic.org
[fantasque-sans]: https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans
[nerd-fonts]: https://www.nerdfonts.com

```css
:root {
  --ls-font-family: "OpenDyslexic";
  --ls-page-text-size: 18px;
}

.extensions__code .CodeMirror {
  font-family: "FantasqueSansMono NF", monospace;
}

.content :not(pre) > code {
    font-family: "FantasqueSansMono NF", monospace;
}
```


Now I want to go all in and make a proper theme.
