Got Org Babel playing nice with TypeScript thanks to [ob-typescript][ob-ts].
It's a wild Saturday morning here.

![an Emacs Org file showing output of executed typescript block](@img/2022/2022-06-11-emacs-typescript.png "Takes a bit to get there on WSL but the code *does* run.")

That required a few more lines in my config, but not *too* many.

```lisp
(use-package ob-typescript)
(use-package org
  ;; ...
  :config
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    '((typescript . t))))
```

I also followed my own [advice][tide-note] and added [Tide][tide] for TypeScript
support in Emacs. Just copied and pasted from all the links, so config's a bit
of a mess.

Oh hey that's right I still need to take my ADHD meds. I'll go do that now.
