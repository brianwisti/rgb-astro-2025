Cats haven't checked in on me for a bit. It's nice. A bit creepy, but nice.

![cats staring at you patiently](/img/2022/2022-07-18-cats.jpg "Okay human, now do something interesting.")

Oh and for a little bit of [Nushell][nushell] geekery, here's how I copied the newest
photo from Dropbox sync to the folder for this post â€” since neither are named
in a readily accessible pattern for quick typing:

```nushell
cp (ls ~/Dropbox/Camera | last | get name) $"(ls content/posts/2022/07/ | last | get name)/cats.jpg"
```
