This week the Linux partition is [EndeavourOS][endeavour-os] â€” specifically
[Qtile Community Edition][qtile-edition].

[endeavour-os]: https://endeavouros.com
[qtile-edition]: https://discovery.endeavouros.com/window-tiling-managers/qtile/2022/01/

![Qtile desktop](@img/2022/2022-07-15-desktop.png "You have to add a few things to make tiling window manager screenshots interesting.")

So far, I like it.

And yeah, I think I still want the tumblelog for sharing quick links and what
not. I'll tie it in a bit more closely with the [main blog][rgb-blog], but I
will let it live as its own separate site.
