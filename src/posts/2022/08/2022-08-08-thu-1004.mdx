I tried visually replacing a few [Logseq][logseq] tags with icons in CSS. It worked!

How'd I do it? Inspired by Obsidian's [Alternate Checkboxes](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/CSS+Snippets/Alternate+Checkboxes+(SlRvb)) CSS snippet, I started with a tag like `#idea` and looked at the element structure in the dev console:

```html
<div
    class=""
    style="display: inline;"
    data-tooltipped=""
    aria-describedby="tippy-tooltip-119"
    data-original-title="null"
    ><a
        data-ref="idea"
        class="tag">#idea</a></div>
```


Set up [CSS Selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) based on the `data-ref` attribute. For styling, I wanted to hide the text and replace it with an icon.

```css
a.tag[data-ref="idea"] {
border: none;
font-size: 0;
}
```

Append an icon with the font size we started at

```css
a.tag[data-ref="idea"]:after {
    content: "ðŸ’¡";
    font-size: initial;
}
```

as-is, this has accessibility issues and `font-size: initial` won't work with headings. Also, to do it right I should be encoding the icon. But for a quick hack, this is fine.
