title: How About a Tumblelog
---

Thanks to Twitter turbulence, folks are rediscovering the joys of blogging.
I've got a blog --- this site right here --- so I thought I'd try a
[tumblelog][tumblelog] instead. Mixing Org mode journaling and ox-hugo for the
next evolution of this site's Notes experiment.

There will be more to say about it later when I get home from vacation.

:::note{title="2024-12-30"}
There was a separate site, which got ignored and then folded back into the [Notes][notes] category on this site.
