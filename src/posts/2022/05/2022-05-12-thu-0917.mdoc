Seeing if I set up `ox-hugo` [auto-export](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving/) correctly. Yep, though it didn't apply until I reverted / reloaded this Org buffer.

`SITE/.dir-locals.el` looks like this:

<a id="code-snippet--.dir-locals.el"></a>
```elisp
(("content-org/"
  . ((org-mode . ((eval . (org-hugo-auto-export-mode)))))))
```

Now `ox-hugo` exports the current subtree every time I save.

```

Okay cool. Anyways, back to work.
