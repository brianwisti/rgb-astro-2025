title: Less Is More for 2024
---

Been working on various iterations of the site.
But all the tools and toys I play with, I find myself craving less.
Less embellishment, fewer bells and whistles, more purpose.

There's a truism about UNIX tools. Each does only one thing. It does that one thing well, but nothing else.

We don't talk about Emacs.

I think it's more that good tools — not just in UNIX — have one clear purpose.
They may do several things, but those things all pointed squarely at that purpose.

So I'm exploring tools that feel purposeful to me.
[Fossil][fossil] comes to mind, though there are others.
And admitting that I won't discard [Hugo][hugo] any time soon.
Not in the long term, anyways.
It serves the purpose of preparing a static Web site exceptionally well.

Consistency is not my strong suit, but I'll keep that urge for less in mind with the new year.

The site's new look is a rapidly diverging variation on [Poison][poison],
which is itself derived from [Hyde][hyde] — at this point a classic blog theme.

Happy New Year. Have fun!
