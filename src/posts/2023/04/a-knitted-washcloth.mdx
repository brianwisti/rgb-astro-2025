title: A Knitted Washcloth
---

A washcloth on its own is no big deal, but it's been a *while* since I finished any knitting.

This particular washcloth pattern came printed inside the wrapper of some Lily [Sugar'n Cream][lily-yarn] yarn, of the "Fruit Punch" color variety. Fairly straightforward pattern but even so I think I did more yarn-overs than on any project that comes to mind.
