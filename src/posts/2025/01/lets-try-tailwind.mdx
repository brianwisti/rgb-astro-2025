import UsesLink from "@components/UsesLink.astro"

Hey I already switched this blog over to [Astro][astro].
Why not keep trying new and interestingly uncomfortable things?
So now all the site styles are done with [Tailwind][tailwind] classes.
Well.
Most of them.
Still some of the more interesting CSS I haven't figure out how to map over.

[astro]: https://astro.build
[tailwind]: https://tailwindcss.com

Will I stick with it?
As always, I have no idea.

So hey while it has my attention:
use [Astro's `class:list` directive][classlist] to pass Tailwind class names up the component chain.
Here's a tidied-up example.
Please forgive my beginner-ness with both Astro and Tailwind.

[classlist]: https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#classlist

Say I use a UsesLink component, which would link to a list of posts where I talked about using Astro.

```astro title="lets-try-tailwind.mdx"
<UsesLink used="astro" />
```

UsesLink itself is pretty small.

```astro title="src/components/UsesLink.astro"
---
import TaxonomyLink from "./core/TaxonomyLink.astro"

const { used } = Astro.props
---

<TaxonomyLink
    href={`/uses/${used}/`}
    class="font-semibold"><slot>{used}</slot></TaxonomyLink>
```

It calls the more generic TaxonomyLink, passing a Tailwind class name as a prop.

```astro title="TaxonomyLink.astro"
---
const { href, class: className = "" } = Astro.props
---

<a class:list={[
   "p-category",
   "bg-amber-300",
   "text-slate-950",
   "inline-block",
   "rounded-md",
   "mx-1",
   "px-2",
   "py-1",
   className ]} {href}><slot /></a>
```

TaxonomyLink uses `class:list` to paste that class prop onto a handful it's already using.
The full list gets rendered in the final HTML.

```html
<a
  class="p-category bg-amber-300 text-slate-950 inline-block rounded-md mx-1 px-2 py-1 font-semibold"
  href="/uses/astro/">astro</a>
```

Oh and I'm writing this in a MDX file so I can just show you right here!
The color classes will of course have changed multiple times by the time you read this.

<UsesLink used="astro" />

I still don't know if all those class names, and the extra steps to use them cleanly, is better than just using CSS.
But hey I'm having fun, and can decipher more of contemporary corporate Web design.

Anyways I'm kinda craving a donut right now.
