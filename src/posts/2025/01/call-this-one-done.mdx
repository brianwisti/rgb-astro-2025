import ColoringPage from "@components/ColoringPage.astro"

According to the [Linea Sketch][linea] file export naming scheme, I started this drawing on the 29th of October last year.
Haven't worked on it *every* night.
Exported as a Photoshop PSD file and fiddled a bit with [Pixelmator Pro][pixelmator] this morning.
Not one hundred percent sure of the outcome, but that's more about my skill with desktop image applications.

Still.
It is a pretty picture.
I need to share more of those.

<ColoringPage base="2025/2024-10-29-drawing" format="png" />

I also need to fiddle with how I do the responsive image thing.
The image is a little blurry at some window sizes.
