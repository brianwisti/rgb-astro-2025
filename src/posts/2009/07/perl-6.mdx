This page once contained many links to [Perl 6][] information as the design notes
were being assembled for the newest revision of this language. Those links are
painfully out of date now. I'll streamline instead with a few core ideas:

* There may be multiple implementations of [Perl 6][], but the accepted standard is [Raku][raku-lang].
* Rakudo runs on the virtual machine known as [Parrot][]. Parrot runs more than 
  just Perl 6, though. There are several [languages][] being developed for this platform.
