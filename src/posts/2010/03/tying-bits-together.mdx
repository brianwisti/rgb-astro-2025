I'm working on tying together the blog and my site. A little [JQuery][] magic
expands the RSS feed of this blog for visitors to [coolnamehere][]. I'll
improve the integration over time, probably by adjusting the template used
for the blog. Meanwhile, I have more incentive to use Blogger.

I'll probably add feeds from other services to the site, such as _Buzz_ or
[Twitter][twitter]. I use those frequently, and they are great for the short
thoughts that don't belong in either a blog post or a static page.
