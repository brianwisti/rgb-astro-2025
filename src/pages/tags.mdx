Hopefully you know what a tag is, because they are hard to explain.
They're keywords and phrases that describe some aspect of a given post.
Sometimes it's a topic.
Sometimes it's a tool -- though that should be under [`/uses`][uses] now.
Sometimes it's a mood.
Sometimes it's a bad joke.
For imported archive stuff, it could be the site where I originally wrote it.
Could be just about anything really.
