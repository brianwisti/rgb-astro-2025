I collect notes, projects, and somewhat random thoughts here.
Different versions of this site have been online since sometime in 2000.

My name is Brian Wisti, and I am a geek.
This site should provide plenty of evidence for that.
I usually write code for a living, and often write code as a hobby.

I was born in 1972, in Tacoma, Washington.
That’s in the northwestern United States for those of you reading this from a great distance.
I moved from Washington State to Tucson in 2024.

I have more hobbies than I know what to do with.
That's the "random" in Random Geekery.
These days, I spend a lot of time programming, knitting, or drawing.
I spend more time programming, but it’s hard to tell whether I’ve been programming or
drawing for more time.
They both seem to satisfy my general urge to create something.
From other people, each gets a different reaction.
More people go "oh, cool" at my drawings.
More people are willing to pay me for my programming.
So I get to do all the things I enjoy and stay very happy.
