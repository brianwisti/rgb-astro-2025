## Where I am now

[tucson]: https://www.visittucson.org

Living in [Tucson][tucson], in Arizona's Sonora desert. It's been an interesting shift after living near Puget Sound most of my life.


## Who I am around now

[mrs-geek]: https://hackers.town/@IamMrsGeek/

Let's see. There are four humans and four critters. Full details about the humans are unnecessary, but I am happily married to [one][mrs-geek] of them. The other two are pretty cool.

The critters? Two dogs, two cats.


## What I am doing now

[linkedin]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti

Job hunting, mostly. Looking for a senior backend dev? Here's my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin].

What else?

[astro]: https://astro.build

- getting old; better than the alternative complaints range from a perpetually blocked ear to fingernail ridges
- rebuilding my site in [Astro][astro] to have some fun with frontend tech in a SSG context
