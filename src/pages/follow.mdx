I automatically share new posts on [Mastodon][ht-me].
[RSS][rss] is the best way to follow this site, though.
It works even when my announcement scripts don't.

[rss]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS

An RSS file summarizes recent updates on a site.
Feed reader apps, such as [Feedly][feedly] (web), [Newsflash][newsflash] (Linux), or [NewNewsWire][nnn] (macOS), let you subscribe to all the sites you like. 
This lets you read updates on your own schedule.

[newsflash]: https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk
[nnn]: https://netnewswire.com

Subscribe to the Random Geekery blog by copying and pasting the link below --- the link itself, not the XML file you see if you click the link --- into your feed reader app!

:::note
Sometimes I have multiple feed links here. Those come and go based on my latest experiments, but the main one should stay pretty consistent.

[Main Feed](/index.xml)
: keep up with everything on the site; right now that's just blog posts, but sometimes it includes experiments with new non-post content types
