Follow the blog, and follow me personally on social networks.

I automatically share new posts on [Mastodon](https://hackers.town/@randomgeek). [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is the best way to follow this site, though. It works even when my announcement scripts don't.

An RSS file summarizes recent updates on a site. Feed reader apps, such as [Feedly](https://feedly.com) (web), [Newsflow](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/newsflow/9NBLGGH58S5R) (Windows), [FeedReader](https://jangernert.github.io/FeedReader/) (Linux), or [NewNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) (macOS), let you subscribe to all the sites you like. This lets you read updates on your own schedule.

Subscribe to the Random Geekery blog by copying and pasting the link below --- the link itself, not the XML file you see if you click the link --- into your feed reader app!

<Note>
Sometimes I have multiple feed links here. Those come and go based on my latest experiments, but the main one should stay pretty consistent.

keep up with everything on the site; right now that's just blog posts, but sometimes it includes experiments with new non-post content types
