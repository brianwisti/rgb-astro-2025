A [`/uses`][uses] page is one way to record favorite or at least frequently recurring items from your toolbox.

Check out the [Awesome /uses][awesome-uses] page if you want some ideas for your own `/uses` page!

I had to come up with an additional taxonomy to record what gets used in at least some of my posts.
Because I can't sit still long enough to come up with a hard-coded `/uses` page like what the cool kids have.

And keep in mind: this isn't everything I use.
Mostly it's the stuff I like to talk about.
And currently it's the stuff I like to talk about that I thought to go back and pull out of the post tags.
