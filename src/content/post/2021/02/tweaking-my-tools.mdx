[TTY Toolkit]: https://ttytoolkit.org

Playing a little more with [TTY Toolkit][] for the site workflow.
I wanted to say I'm tightening focus, but with a `require` list like this for one tool?

```ruby
require 'pastel'
require 'ruby-slugify'
require 'tty-editor'
require 'tty-exit'
require 'tty-logger'
require 'tty-option'
require 'tty-prompt'
require 'tty-screen'
```

"Tightening focus" would be a lie.

Anyways, it seems to function correctly. Huzzah! Now back to work.
