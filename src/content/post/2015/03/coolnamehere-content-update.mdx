import TagLink from "@components/TagLink.astro"

I got bored of the old coolnamehere pages
effectively sitting outside of the site because of the way
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) — and pretty much every other static
blogging system — treats pages as secondary to posts. It makes sense,
anyways. Once you stop bikeshedding about where to put content in your
elaborate directory structure, it gets easier to add stuff.

So with a bit of Ruby code, some time attempting to
correct publishing dates on [archive.org](http://archive.org), scrubbing
repeatedly over internal links with
[linkchecker](http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/), and heavy usage of
the
[jekyll-pageless-redirects](https://github.com/nquinlan/jekyll-pageless-redirects)
plugin, the important content of the site has a consistent presentation.

Check <TagLink tag="coolnamehere" /> to satisfy your historic curiosity.

And *of course* there are still going to be issues with that old
content.
