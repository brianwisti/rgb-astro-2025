Big news of the week is that I'm looking for work.

## Jots

What's up?

- job hunting; check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti/) if you're looking for a remote or hybrid mostly backend senior dev based near Seattle
- building Kotlin and Kubernetes familiarity for some specific job prospects; I could see enjoying Kotlin, and I'm starting to understand how and when Kubernetes is useful; I remain a fan of small tools when reasonable, though
- working towards a new public brain by creating an Obsidian vault from this site and pulling recurring concepts into topic cards

## Plan

What's coming up next week?

- job search is the priority, won't bother you with the search / submit / follow-up task list
- plan out how to build a new version of the site that would include posts and public cards, including pre-processing for posts that are integrated with Obsidian's Markdown extras and automated testing of the results

## Bookmarks

Kind of a theme this week. One might even call it a mood.

Cassidy's correct that the human-curated Web is still here — I mean hello it me
— and also correct that it's a lot harder to find thanks to algorithm-driven
social networks and search engines; guess we'll have to go back to
old-fashioned ways like blogrolls, webrings, bookmark pages, and variations
like this weekly review

predicting that more LLM spam and the "AI" boom in general will result in more
people splitting off from the old big social networks and platforms, being more
creative to differentiate between the plausible mediocrity generated by
automated systems; I would love for it to be true
