What can I say about Perl? I’ve had very little to talk about it on this site over the years,
despite the fact that I use Perl on an almost daily basis.
It’s not as cute as Ruby, or as clean as Python, but it’s always there.
There have been numerous projects that are just plain easier in Perl.
I can’t explain it.

## Interesting Perl Sites

There are lots of excellent Perl sites out there. You can prove it for
yourself by checking in your favorite Web search site. I’ve decided to
list my favorites below, though. It’s a bit easier than digging through
the directory.

- [perl.org][perl-org] is the defacto home page for Perl on the Web.
- [perlmonks][perlmonks] is the place to ask questions.

[perl-org]: https://www.perl.org
[perlmonks]: https://perlmonks.org

The list was longer in 2002, but not many sites survive 23 years intact.
