title: PageTemplate - Getting It
---

We have tried to make installing PageTemplate as easy as possible. There
are three basic ways to install PageTemplate:

- With RubyGems
- With Rake
- Manually

## With RubyGems

This is by far the easiest approach.

```
gem install pagetemplate
```

See?
Okay, you might need to use `sudo` if you are on a UNIX-y machine, but that’s still not too hard.

## With Rake

Download the archived file from the [PageTemplate project page][repo].
Extract the file into a convenient location and enter the top-level directory.

```
rake
rake test
sudo rake install
```

[repo]: https://github.com/brianwisti/PageTemplate

You can also install files into your favorite directory by supplying
`setup.rb` some options. Try `ruby setup.rb --help`. Since we don’t
really know how `setup.rb` works, we’ve included the English-language
version of the setup usage file in the archive. Enjoy.
