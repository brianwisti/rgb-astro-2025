title: We went to the mall. Later, I bought an app.

We went to the [Apple][] store. I played with a new iPad Pro. Tried hard not to like it, but it was a really
pleasant experience.

The demo iPad had a great note-taking app that could help my search for an app that let me handwrite notes and
then search through their content later.

Been messing with Windows and [WSL 2][] more lately. So we went to the [Microsoft][] store too. I tried hard
to like it, but everything felt a little clumsy and disappointing after the smoothness of the Apple devices.

When I got home I had to find and install [GoodNotes][], the notebook app I played with at the Apple Store, on
my own iPad. Yeah I like it. This will come in real handy.

Oh and I want a matte screen *protector*. Supposedly gives you more of a paper feel when working on the iPad.
