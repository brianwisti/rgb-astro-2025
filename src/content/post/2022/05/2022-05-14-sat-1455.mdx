We now return to our regularly scheduled programming. I reinstalled [Regolith](https://regolith-linux.org/). Yes it's based on Ubuntu 20.04. In my case that's a plus, since some proprietary tools I rely on have not been updated for 22.04. I feel like I have what I need with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) over Regolith.
