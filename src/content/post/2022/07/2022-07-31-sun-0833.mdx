Woke up, saw a [Planet Crafter][planet-crafter] update, trying to find out what
it is, grumbling about there being no announcement.

Oh wait I think that's because they were still typing it. 

Announcement timestamped eight minutes before I started writing this and
roughly one minute after I woke up.

Copied and pasted.

:::quote{title="Insects & Waterfall Update is now LIVE!" cite="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1284190/announcements/detail/3374903257121974931"}

You can explore right away the 3 new biomes, find and collect 15 new
butterflies species, create beehive and collect honey, breed silkworm and
produce silk. Discover new secrets, unlock new achievements and experience
new meteo events.

I think maybe they're still waking up too.

Here's the preview for visual folks.
