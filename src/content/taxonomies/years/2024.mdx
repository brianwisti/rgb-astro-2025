description: tried weekly updates, got bored, moved to Tucson

I didn't move to Tucson because I got bored of doing the snapshot posts.
That would be silly.
But yeah 2024 was a very quiet year on Random Geekery.
Started with the weekly snapshots and another attempt at sharing my public notes, but I wasn't happy with the workflow I had come up with.

Decided to roll back to a basic blog flow again and go from there.
That seems to have done the trick.
