title: Thinking about Hugo again but maybe with Site.js
---

Goodness I may dislike that templating language, but it's hard to match
anything against [Hugo][]'s 700ms average build time on a cleaned-up version of
my site.

[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io
[Site.js]: https://sitejs.org

But I'm having fun with the JavaScript too. Maybe I'll mash them both together
by using [Site.js][], which supports Hugo under the hood for fancier static
sites.
