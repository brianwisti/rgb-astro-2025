Lots of folks stuck at home.

Feel like coloring something? I decided to share the linework for this drawing.

<ColoringPage base="2020/sepia-sunburst" format="png" />

Print it. Import it into your favorite coloring / sketch app. Whatever.  Have
fun!

And you don’t *have* to show me what you do with it, but I’d love it if you
did!
