title: That Is Just Embarrassing
---

Got an [Invoke](/tags/pyinvoke) `test` task for the site. Because of
that, I found a post about [Jekyll
collections](/post/2015/07/making-a-jekyll-collection) that got
truncated â€” before the current repo existed.

Fixed it though. Got the missing content from an [old
copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160318224730/http://randomgeekery.org/post/2015/making-a-jekyll-collection).
Yay for Internet Archive\!
