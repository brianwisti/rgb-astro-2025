I made [Astro][astro] build my `.htaccess` file for server-side redirects with [Apache][apache-httpd].
With over a decade as Random Geekery, my site --

[astro]: https://astro.build/
[apache-httpd]: https://httpd.apache.org/

Look I'm gonna go straight to the code and do the explanation after.
If you need this information, you need it now.

Put your generating logic in a `GET` function exported from `src/pages/ENDPOINT.js`.

```javascript title="src/pages/htaccess.js"
import { getCollection } from "astro:content"

export async function GET(context) {
  const posts = await getCollection("posts")

  const directiveText = posts.map((post) =>
    post.data.aliases.map((alias) => `Redirect 301 ${alias} /post/${post.id}/`)
  ).flat().join("\n")

  return new Response(directiveText)
}
```

Astro didn't seem `src/pages/.htaccess.js`, possibly because it assumes hidden files should be ignored.
Instead I build an `/htaccess` endpoint, and ensured my task runner renames the `htaccess` file afterwards.


```make title="Justfile"
build:
  npm run build
  mv dist/htaccess dist/.htaccess
```

That's all.

:::note{title="Netlify _redirects too"}

Untested, but I suspect the same flow lets you build a [Netlify _redirects][netlify-redirects] file.
You need to fiddle with the details a bit:
`_redirects.js` instead of `htaccess.js` and `{$alias} /post/${postId}` instead of a Rewrite directive.
On the other hand, you shouldn't have to rename the generated file!

Okay now I can get back to rambling.

## Why did I do this

With over a decade as Random Geekery, my site has seen multiple site generators and perennial reorganization ideas.
I have a thousand redirects -- 1,076 to be precise.
Other people linked to my site at some point, and I changed the URL since.
I still want them to get the post they were linking to!


## Client-side redirects in Astro

You can [configure redirects in Astro][astro-redirects].
In SSG mode, Astro redirects are implemented as HTML files with `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`.
I can specify them as a mapping of old permalinks to new permalinks in my config.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"

export default defineConfig({
  redirects: {
    "/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/": "/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/",
  },
})
```

Astro currently uses `redirect` configuration to generate files like this on build.

```html title="/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/index.html"
<!doctype html>
<title>Redirecting to: https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/</title>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards">
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/">
<body>
  <a href="https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/">
    Redirecting from <code>/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/</code> to <code>https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/</code>
  </a>
</body>
```

That tells the browser "immediately refresh your location to `https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/`,"
while also informing the user that they're being redirected.
Just in case the browser isn't cooperative.

This is what most static site generators do for redirects.
It works.
Sometimes it's the only option available.
Client-side redirects like this are not ideal, because they add work for the user agent --
usually a desktop browser, but could be a bot or other Web-capable application.

1. user agent fetches the initial URL
2. Web server hands back `HTTP 200` and an HTML page containing the refresh meta
3. user agent parses the HTTP message and the HTML page, noting the refresh and new URL
4. user agent (probably) updates its location, fetching the new URL
5. for however long it takes to start reloading, you (might) see a link telling you this is a redirect

For you, the whole thing is pretty much instantaneous, assuming your system and network connection are up to par.
But it's still extra work.
To make matters worse, it might even [break the back button][w3c-reback].
I have [wrestled with redirect accessibility][alias-templates] before.
Unsuccessfully, I might add.

[alias-templates]: /post/2020/05/alias-templates-in-hugo/

[w3c-reback]: https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/reback

Plus there's the problem of an extra thousand lines in my config.
Each page has its permalink history in frontmatter, in the `aliases` field.
That was mainly for [Hugo][hugo-aliases], but I left that data in place in the Astro iteration.

[hugo-aliases]: https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases

I *could* generate my config on the fly to extract redirect metadata --
loading and parsing every page on my site before Astro loads and parses every page on my site.
Or I *could* add a separate preparation task which processes all my pages and creates a data file to be loaded by `astro.config.mjs` --
but then I'd have to rebuild the data file routinely, just in case.

It's easier to just let Astro help the server handle redirects.

## Server-side redirects

Doing the redirect from the server speeds the exchange up considerably.
Instead of returning a Web page to be parsed, processed, and possibly rendered, everything is handled at the [HTTP][http] layer.

[http]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview

```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://randomgeekery.org/post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards/index.html
```

The server responds to `HTTP GET` requests for the old page with [HTTP 301][http-301] to tell your user agent:
"That link is at this new location, and you can cache that, because it'll be true forever."

Well -- as much as anything online can be "forever."

[http-301]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/301

The process now looks something like this:

1. user agent fetches the initial URL
2. Web server hands back the HTTP message
3. user agent parses the HTTP message
4. user agent (probably) updates its location, fetching the new URL
5. for however long it takes to fetch, you (might) see a browser status bar update telling you this is a redirect

Honestly it has been a very long time since I saw step five for server-side redirects.

## Server-side redirects with Astro SSG

So how do I set up server-side redirects?
Well, you already saw the code.

Oh what the heck.
We'll go over it anyways.

Random Geekery is served by Apache on a shared host.
This Apache server processes server directives in a site-specific `.htaccess` file, and enables [redirect rules][mod-rewrite].
Meanwhile, Astro can build files for endpoints via a corresponding source file.
That file needs export a `GET` function, reflecting to what is expected from `HTTP GET` of that endpoint.

[mod-rewrite]: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/remapping.html

```javascript title="src/pages/htaccess.js"
export async function GET(context) {
}
```

:::note

Remember the trouble I mentioned with `.htaccess.js`.
That's why I skipped the leading dot.

:::

As mentioned, permalink aliases are in post frontmatter.
I need to access each of the posts for that.
Since we are in Astro's build process, I can get the collection that Astro already loaded.

```javascript title="src/pages/htaccess.js"
import { getCollection } from "astro:content"

export async function GET(context) {
  const posts = await getCollection("posts")
}
```

My `.htaccess` file needs a redirect rule for each mapping of old URL to new URL.
1,075 variations of this, bundled into a single plain text file:

```text
Redirect 301 /2020/04/11/indieweb-h-cards/ /post/2020/04/indieweb-h-cards
```

Since my schema defines the default for `aliases` as a new empty array, I can be presumptuous.
Map over each post's possibly empty list of aliases, generating lists of redirect rule strings.
Then I can flatten them into a single list and turn it into a single string.

```javascript title="src/pages/htaccess.js"
export async function GET(context) {
  // ...

  const directiveText = posts.map((post) =>
    post.data.aliases.map((alias) => `Redirect 301 ${alias} /post/${post.id}/`)
  ).flat().join("\n")
}
```

All Astro needs now from the `GET` function is a `Response`.

```javascript title="src/pages/htaccess.js"
import { getCollection } from "astro:content"

export async function GET(context) {
  // ...

  return new Response(directiveText)
}
```

After `npm run build` I move the generated file to its expected location.

```sh
mv dist/htaccess dist/.htaccess
```

A very good candidate for automation, since that's easy to forget when doing the whole thing manually.

## Wrap it up

Astro's ability to generate arbitrary endpoints came in handy when I wanted to make more accessible redirects.
I need to build and transfer 1,075 fewer files than before adding `.htaccess` to my site build process.
I had fun.
It's all good.
