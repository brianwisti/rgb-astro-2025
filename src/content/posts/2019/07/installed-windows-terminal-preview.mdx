title: Installed Windows Terminal Preview
---

Windows partition is [Fast Ring][] now, but that took the full night. All
I had time for this morning was installing the fancy – and [open source][]! –
[terminal][] preview from the [Windows Store][].

[Fast Ring]: https://insider.windows.com/en-us/how-to-overview/
[open source]: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/LICENSE
[terminal]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-microsoft-store-preview-release/
[Windows Store]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab

I'll finish breaking my computer after work. BTW, still figuring out build
numbers but I don't think Windows Insider builds are required to install the
terminal preview. May 2019 update *should* be fine.
