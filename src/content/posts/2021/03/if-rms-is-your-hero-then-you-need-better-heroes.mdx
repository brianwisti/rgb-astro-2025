[thoughts]: https://kevq.uk/my-thoughts-on-richard-stallmans-return-to-the-fsf-board/

Yeah this is about Stallman being back on the board of the FSF. Kev Quirk has
good [thoughts] about how it was communicated. Me, I'm tired. I had *just* been
thinking how some of my favorite people have been driven off the public Internet
via doxxing and harrassment.

And now Free Software's problematic fave -- one of many, to be honest -- is
back, without so much as a hint of personal responsibility. Bah.

I'm not purging my system or anything, but I'm sure as hell done making a point
of using GNU tools. This affects the FSF not one bit. It's only me conserving my
energy for things I can care about.
