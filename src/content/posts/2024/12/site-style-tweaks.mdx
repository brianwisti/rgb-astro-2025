Even though the blog itself has been quiet, I spent most of the year puttering on different iterations of the site. I've still got some ideas for the year ahead â€“ maybe something practical? Or maybe a skill-builder like Astro or Gatsby? Not sure yet.

For now, I made myself a new theme tweaking [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) heavily, sprinkled with a whole lot of predefined CSS variables from [Open Props](https://open-props.style). Still a few pieces missing, but I can get that later. Mrs Geek has a birthday to celebrate today!

Oh and I'm using [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) and Emacs to write the new posts. If I want something besides Hugo in a future iteration, I'll want to take that into account. There's always [Orga.js](https://orga.js.org).
